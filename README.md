# Time Capsule (2019-2022)

### Gist

This website is a showcase of my creative work during my undergraduate studies in Digital Art and Media Design, B.Des, where I emphasized interactive media and front-end design. I am now moving on to complete a master's in Information Systems (emphasizing Human-Computer Interaction). 

### Fluff

I belong to one of the first generations raised with technological literacy as a cornerstone of our upbringing. I have owned a Windows desktop since I was four, playing Barbie and pre-k educational games. By the time I was eight, I had discovered YouTube, a daily staple ever since. At eleven, my first online research assignment was to create a website that not only educated readers on a chosen topic but also cited its sources. Navigating through vast online databases with ease, I was captivated from the start. I quickly mastered typing full sentences on a keyboard and outpaced my parents in smartphone texting speed.

My life is a testament to my passion for digital media and interactive design. Whether I'm formally studying these subjects or just chatting about them, I can't help but express my excitement for all things digital and innovative. I've come to see the significant role that automation and digital tools play in enhancing productivity and shaping the social fabric of our communities.

I deeply value people's access to information, access to opportunities, and democratic representation. The expanding global access to data and tools is reshaping our notions of production, creativity, and ethics in this new tech-driven era. I'm committed to fostering positive outcomes from these ongoing developments.
